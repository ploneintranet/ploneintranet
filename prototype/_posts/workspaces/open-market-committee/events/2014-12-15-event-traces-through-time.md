The aim of the <a href="#">Traces through Time</a> project is to develop a methodology and toolkit that will enable researchers to automatically identify individuals across large and disparate historical datasets. Whether you are working with thirteenth-century legal material or records of military service from the twentieth century, the tools and approaches developed will allow you to search across datasets, revealing individual connections in an academically rigorous way. As well as enabling quicker and more accurate research, they will support the tracing of threads through time, making new connections between datasets and empowering historians to explore data in ways that are currently impossible.

Tickets are free, but places are limited. Find out more and <a href="#">book your ticket here.</a>
