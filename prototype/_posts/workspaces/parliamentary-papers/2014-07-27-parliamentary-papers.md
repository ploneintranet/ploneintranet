description: "'Parliamentary paper' is a term used to describe a document which
is laid before Parliament. Most government organisations will produce at least
one parliamentary paper per year.

A range of services are provided under contract to help government organisations
make sure that their parliamentary papers are produced to the required standard.

Errors in parliamentary papers are rare but there are services available to help
correct a document appropriately.
