## Air Canada selected from more than 80,000 employers considered for designation

MONTREAL, Nov. 4, 2014 /CNW Telbec/ - Air Canada has been recognized as one of "Canada's Top 100 Employers" for a second consecutive year in an annual employer survey by Mediacorp Canada Inc. The national competition, which begins by examining the recruitment histories of more than 80,000 employers across Canada, chooses top companies after conducting a detailed review of their operations and Human Resources practices, including a comparison of others in their industry and region.

"Air Canada is very proud to again be named among the Top 100 Employers in Canada. The well-being of our employees is a strategic priority for our company and this award affirms that we offer a workplace environment featuring best-practice programs and working conditions. The fact our employees feel valued is reflected in the extraordinary efforts they make every day to transport our customers safely and in comfort and to deliver a level of service that has earned Air Canada the only Four Star rating among North American network carriers," said Arielle Meloul-Wechsler, Vice President Human Resources at Air Canada. "Air Canada has long been regarded as a progressive employer and on average we receive 100 applications for each job we fill. Being selected one of Canada's Top 100 Employers is welcome validation of our efforts to create a working environment that offers people varied and fulfilling career opportunities."

Mediacorp's "Canada's Top 100 Employers" project is an annual competition that evaluates and identifies the country's leading companies and organizations for attracting and retaining employees.  The competition focuses on eight key areas: physical workplace; work and social atmosphere; health, financial and family benefits; vacation and time off; employee communications; performance management; training and skills development and community involvement. In selecting Air Canada, Mediacorp cited a range of employee programs at the company including its charitable work with children, employee recognition programs, Air Canada's defined benefit pension plan and enhanced maternity benefits.
