* The index_html portal_tabs action comprises the default value when determining which tab is active. If an arbitrary browser view is called on the portal root which is not present in the portal_tabs, the index_html action will be highlighted in the tab navi as current. This is not true however, one example is the notifications view. If viewed, it highlights the dashboard. The proper solution is to have a hidden Home action that also points to the dashboard and a regular dashboard action that only highlights when actually loaded. [Alexander Pilz]

* Added docstrings to the more complext tests [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a test for the MembraneGroupPropertiesProvider [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Adapt our dexterity membrane groups behavior to IMembraneUserProperties, so that our membrane-workspaces can have property sheets, e.g. for title [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a test for the scenario: User X is member of workspace A, WS A is member of WS B, WS B is member of WS C Then User X is member of workspace C [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Moved activating the IMembraneGroup behavior to setUpPloneSite of the testing layer [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add an event handler that checks if the FTI for workspaces was modied & the IMembraneUserGroups behavior added or removed. In this case update the membrane tool and reindex all workspaces [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to make sure our IMembraneGroup behavior provides IMembraneUserGroups, so that the membrane_groups plugin can found out, which workspaces a workspace is a member of. Example: Workspace B has as member Workspace A Workspace A can only know (in the membrane sense) that it is a member of workspace B via the IMembraneUserGroups lookup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* use membrane users, not basic PloneUsers, so that the permissions based on membership in a membrane group will be properly assigned [Wolfgang Thomas]
* we need to make sure the Products.membrane profile is applied to the site in test setup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* make sure the membrane_groups plugin comes before recursive_groups [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Creating a behaviour for IGroup provides the lookup workspace->members. But still missing (in the security sense) is the lookup user->workspaces, which is required for checking access permissions of an individual user. If access is granted to a user indirectly via membership in a workspace-group, this missing lookup would lead to Unauthorized. Therefore, we need to adapt the membrane user object (for dexterity) so that it also implements IMembraneUserGroups and thereby fulfils the contract of IGroupsPlugin from Products.PluggableAuthService [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a failing test that checks if permisison via group membership in a groupspace gets properly propagated [Wolfgang Thomas]

1.1.0a0 (2016-04-06)
--------------------

* Prepare intermediate private release 1.1.0a0
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'quaive/master' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge branch 'release-1.0.x' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #35 from quaive/34-fix-unindexing-problem [Guido Stevens]
* overwrite default indexer for getObjPositionInParent, so that we can add a try-except block. Reason: during unindexing (in the solr code), fetching the position of an obj that is in the process of being deleted will fail, see #34 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #31 from quaive/add-csrf-token-to-paste [Guido Stevens]
* Due to the recent change how the bulk actions work, the csrf token was not passed anymore and thus the paste failed. This readds the token [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #30 from quaive/translation-support [Guido Stevens]
* fix changed order [Alexander Pilz]
* translation fixes [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #28 from quaive/library-fix-order [Guido Stevens]
* Merge branch 'master' into library-fix-order In the conflicted src/ploneintranet/docconv/client/handlers.py I picked the version from master, since its effect is equivalent to my solution [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #26 from quaive/ikath-docconv [Guido Stevens]
* bump version [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* When the library content is displayed, the order of the items must be kept [Wolfgang Thomas]
* If items get re-arranged inside the library, make sure the object position in parent gets reindexed [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to index getObjPositionInParent in solr [Wolfgang Thomas]
* In the current version of plone.app.content (3.0.20) there's a bug in the code that creates an `ordering` object: the acquisition context gets removed. This means 1) in our event handler content_edited_in_workspace (docconv), the obj does not have a REQUEST object, but only a string 2) other event handlers that act on IContainerModifiedEvent (sent out after content gets rearranged) cannot perform any operations that require acquisition context I have submitted a PR for this bug: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.content/pull/81 Until it gets merged, with a new release of p.a.content, we need this monkey patch. Therefore, I place all patch-related changes into this single commit, so that we can easily revert it later. [Wolfgang Thomas]
* in testing we load the async layer, but in the profile we don't. I think we should [Alexander Pilz]
* run async tests in async mode on gitlab [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Don't just skip the test [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #27 from quaive/fix-path-depth [Guido Stevens]
* Revert "move code that uses path_depth into block dealing with path" [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* move code that uses path_depth into block dealing with path [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix library view: for computing the current sections and their children, only look one level deep, instead of listing all contents ad infinitum [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix computation of path_depth. We DO NOT want to count the length of the path string, we want to count the number of path elements (including the root). Example: /Plone/library has a depth of 3 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* deactivate test until we figure out how to run the tests with ASYNC_ENABLED==True [Alexander Pilz]
* add the async generation code to pi.async [Alexander Pilz]
* Translation statements [Alexander Pilz]
* restrain image size in stream to a scale [Alexander Pilz]
* cleanup package dependencies [Alexander Pilz]

* Don't convert attachments async just yet, we can't do that properly atm [Alexander Pilz]
* api support for docconv methods [Alexander Pilz]
* Prepare to be able to make docconv asynchronously [Alexander Pilz]
* fix build icon [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #22 from quaive/gitlab-ci [Alexander Pilz]
* Schedule longest-running partial job first for fastest total-job completion in case of runner contention. [Guido A.J. Stevens]
