1.1.0a0 (2016-04-06)
--------------------

* Prepare intermediate private release 1.1.0a0
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'quaive/master' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge branch 'release-1.0.x' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #35 from quaive/34-fix-unindexing-problem [Guido Stevens]
* overwrite default indexer for getObjPositionInParent, so that we can add a try-except block. Reason: during unindexing (in the solr code), fetching the position of an obj that is in the process of being deleted will fail, see #34 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #31 from quaive/add-csrf-token-to-paste [Guido Stevens]
* Due to the recent change how the bulk actions work, the csrf token was not passed anymore and thus the paste failed. This readds the token [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #30 from quaive/translation-support [Guido Stevens]
* fix changed order [Alexander Pilz]
* translation fixes [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #28 from quaive/library-fix-order [Guido Stevens]
* Merge branch 'master' into library-fix-order In the conflicted src/ploneintranet/docconv/client/handlers.py I picked the version from master, since its effect is equivalent to my solution [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #26 from quaive/ikath-docconv [Guido Stevens]
* bump version [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* When the library content is displayed, the order of the items must be kept [Wolfgang Thomas]
* If items get re-arranged inside the library, make sure the object position in parent gets reindexed [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to index getObjPositionInParent in solr [Wolfgang Thomas]
* In the current version of plone.app.content (3.0.20) there's a bug in the code that creates an `ordering` object: the acquisition context gets removed. This means 1) in our event handler content_edited_in_workspace (docconv), the obj does not have a REQUEST object, but only a string 2) other event handlers that act on IContainerModifiedEvent (sent out after content gets rearranged) cannot perform any operations that require acquisition context I have submitted a PR for this bug: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.content/pull/81 Until it gets merged, with a new release of p.a.content, we need this monkey patch. Therefore, I place all patch-related changes into this single commit, so that we can easily revert it later. [Wolfgang Thomas]
* in testing we load the async layer, but in the profile we don't. I think we should [Alexander Pilz]
* run async tests in async mode on gitlab [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Don't just skip the test [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #27 from quaive/fix-path-depth [Guido Stevens]
* Revert "move code that uses path_depth into block dealing with path" [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* move code that uses path_depth into block dealing with path [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix library view: for computing the current sections and their children, only look one level deep, instead of listing all contents ad infinitum [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Fix computation of path_depth. We DO NOT want to count the length of the path string, we want to count the number of path elements (including the root). Example: /Plone/library has a depth of 3 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* deactivate test until we figure out how to run the tests with ASYNC_ENABLED==True [Alexander Pilz]
* add the async generation code to pi.async [Alexander Pilz]
* Translation statements [Alexander Pilz]
* restrain image size in stream to a scale [Alexander Pilz]
* cleanup package dependencies [Alexander Pilz]
* also copy icons [Alexander Pilz]
* fix test. If we have an image, use the scale image url, not the docconv one [Alexander Pilz]
* Don't convert attachments async just yet, we can't do that properly atm [Alexander Pilz]
* api support for docconv methods [Alexander Pilz]
* Prepare to be able to make docconv asynchronously [Alexander Pilz]
* fix build icon [Alexander Pilz]
* Merge pull request #22 from quaive/gitlab-ci [Alexander Pilz]
* Schedule longest-running partial job first for fastest total-job completion in case of runner contention. [Guido A.J. Stevens]
