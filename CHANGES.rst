* First very basic attempt to add a new Role to workspaces, which will be used internally to handle temporary membership in a workspace / case. [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Assignee and Initiator: allow all any user to be added, and only allow actullaly present users to be added (no inventing of new user names) [Wolfgang Thomas]

* Scan env to force microblog into sync mode during testing. This removes nasty race conditions on module globals, removes nasty "dangling thread" errors, while still running production mode in performance-optimized async mode. The tests for async mode are smart enough to turn that on only for those tests. [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Be picky about which object creations we're broadcasting to the stream [Guido A.J. Stevens]

* The index_html portal_tabs action comprises the default value when determining which tab is active. If an arbitrary browser view is called on the portal root which is not present in the portal_tabs, the index_html action will be highlighted in the tab navi as current. This is not true however, one example is the notifications view. If viewed, it highlights the dashboard. The proper solution is to have a hidden Home action that also points to the dashboard and a regular dashboard action that only highlights when actually loaded. [Alexander Pilz]

* Add the workspace's state to the property sheet of the group (and for good measure also the UID, might come in handy...) [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Make the roster view (members of a group in a workspace) play nicely with groups [Wolfgang Thomas]

* Moved activating the IMembraneGroup behavior to setUpPloneSite of the testing layer [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add an event handler that checks if the FTI for workspaces was modied & the IMembraneUserGroups behavior added or removed. In this case update the membrane tool and reindex all workspaces [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to make sure our IMembraneGroup behavior provides IMembraneUserGroups, so that the membrane_groups plugin can found out, which workspaces a workspace is a member of. Example: Workspace B has as member Workspace A Workspace A can only know (in the membrane sense) that it is a member of workspace B via the IMembraneUserGroups lookup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* use membrane users, not basic PloneUsers, so that the permissions based on membership in a membrane group will be properly assigned [Wolfgang Thomas]
* we need to make sure the Products.membrane profile is applied to the site in test setup [Wolfgang Thomas]
* make sure the membrane_groups plugin comes before recursive_groups [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Creating a behaviour for IGroup provides the lookup workspace->members. But still missing (in the security sense) is the lookup user->workspaces, which is required for checking access permissions of an individual user. If access is granted to a user indirectly via membership in a workspace-group, this missing lookup would lead to Unauthorized. Therefore, we need to adapt the membrane user object (for dexterity) so that it also implements IMembraneUserGroups and thereby fulfils the contract of IGroupsPlugin from Products.PluggableAuthService [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a failing test that checks if permisison via group membership in a groupspace gets properly propagated [Wolfgang Thomas]
* 2 more basic tests [Wolfgang Thomas]
* First basic tests for the groupspace behavior [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Add a basic behaviour for Workspacefolder that turns it into a membrane group [Wolfgang Thomas]

1.1.0a0 (2016-04-06)
--------------------

* Prepare intermediate private release 1.1.0a0
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'quaive/master' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge branch 'release-1.0.x' [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* Merge pull request #35 from quaive/34-fix-unindexing-problem [Guido Stevens]
* overwrite default indexer for getObjPositionInParent, so that we can add a try-except block. Reason: during unindexing (in the solr code), fetching the position of an obj that is in the process of being deleted will fail, see #34 [Wolfgang Thomas]
* Merge pull request #31 from quaive/add-csrf-token-to-paste [Guido Stevens]

* Merge pull request #28 from quaive/library-fix-order [Guido Stevens]

* Merge pull request #26 from quaive/ikath-docconv [Guido Stevens]
* bump version [Guido A.J. Stevens]
* When the library content is displayed, the order of the items must be kept [Wolfgang Thomas]
* If items get re-arranged inside the library, make sure the object position in parent gets reindexed [Wolfgang Thomas]
* We also need to index getObjPositionInParent in solr [Wolfgang Thomas]
* In the current version of plone.app.content (3.0.20) there's a bug in the code that creates an `ordering` object: the acquisition context gets removed. This means 1) in our event handler content_edited_in_workspace (docconv), the obj does not have a REQUEST object, but only a string 2) other event handlers that act on IContainerModifiedEvent (sent out after content gets rearranged) cannot perform any operations that require acquisition context I have submitted a PR for this bug: https://github.com/plone/plone.app.content/pull/81 Until it gets merged, with a new release of p.a.content, we need this monkey patch. Therefore, I place all patch-related changes into this single commit, so that we can easily revert it later. [Wolfgang Thomas]
