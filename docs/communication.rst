(plonesocial.*)

We track issues and manage our backlog in an Assembla tracker at

The digital workspace for unstructured data lives in the

`Plone Intranet Marketing Trello board <https://trello.com/ploneintranetconsortium>`_

inside the

`Plone Intranet Consortium Trello organization <https://trello.com/b/azEYVlRD/plone-intranet-marketing>`_.

.. note:: **Please comment on the related Trello cards** and **mention addressed people** with their account id.

**Storage of media assets** is described in detail in :ref:`media_asset_storage_guidelines.rst`

**Setting up urls right** – consult the :ref:`internet_domain_namespace.rst` reference.

.. note::

    If you're a team member but lacking access,

We do not use the Assembla tracker to avoid non tech noise there, distracting the developers.
