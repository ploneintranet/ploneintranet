.. admonition:: Description

    This document describes how to get a source checkout running to be able to develop for Plone Intranet.

We assume you want to do some work on ploneintranet. Here is what you need
to do to get yourself set up.

Setting up Your Development Environment
---------------------------------------

Make sure you have the OS-level packages you need to build Plone, this can be
achieved using `install.plone.dependencies`_.

In addition, for the Plone Intranet file preview functionality, you need docsplit.

You will need some other tools installed for docsplit.  See the
`docsplit installation instructions`_.  Note that Libre Office is
mentioned as optional there, but in Plone Intranet we require it.

.. _`docsplit installation instructions`: https://documentcloud.github.io/docsplit/

On Ubuntu::

    sudo apt-get install ruby
    gem install docsplit

You also need redis for async document conversion::

    sudo apt-get install redis-server

Set-up a development environment::

    git clone https://github.com/ploneintranet/ploneintranet
    cd ploneintranet
    virtualenv --no-site-packages .
    bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
    bin/buildout -c buildout.cfg

.. _`install.plone.dependencies`: https://github.com/collective/install.plone.dependencies


Create a new Plone instance
---------------------------

The following steps activate Plone Intranet and sets up some demo users and workspaces so you can see what's possible.

1. Create a new Plone instance.
#. In the ZMI, go to portal_setup > import. Select `Plone Intranet: Suite : Create Testing Content` and choose `Import all steps` at the bottom of the page.
#. You can now go to the site at http://localhost:8080/Plone. However, don't do this logged in as admin in the ZMI. Logout, or open a new browser window (use Chrome).

The test content setup created some users. Login with one of the following:

================  ================  =====================================
Username          Password          Permissions
================  ================  =====================================
allan_neece       secret            Default user
christian_stoney  secret            Workspace admin with more permissions
alice_lindstrom   secret            Not a member of any workspaces
================  ================  =====================================

Those passwords are not actually secret, they're just the word "secret" without quotes!


Running tests
-------------

See :doc:`../development/testing`



Alternative install strategies
------------------------------

Instead of the normal procedure listed above, alternative buildout strategies for special cases are documented below.

.. note::

   You can safely ignore the instructions below.


Build using the Plone 5 coredev
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``coredev.cfg`` instead of ``buildout.cfg``.

The theme currently only works when enabling the development-mode in the resource-registries, then pressing ``develop css`` and ``develop javascript`` for the bundle ``ploneintranet`` and pressing ``Save``.

Due to a limitation of zc.buildout ``coredev.cfg`` has to have a copy of the same checkouts as ``buildout.cfg``.


Docker-based development environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Instead* of the steps listed above you can alternatively use the supplied `docker.io`_ scripts.
This will provide you with an isolated chroot-like application container.
The source codes will live outside the container in your normal home directory,
so you can easily edit them with your favorite IDE.

1. `Install Docker`_ on your development workstation
2. `git clone git@github.com:ploneintranet/ploneintranet.git`
3. `cd ploneintranet`
4. `sudo make docker-build` will prepare the docker image
5. `sudo make docker-run` will launch the docker image and give you a shell inside

.. note:: Make sure you are inside the docker container (usually your prompt changes!)

1. `make` will fetch the ploneintranet compiled javascript bundle
2. `make devel` will run the development buildout
3. `bin/instance fg` will run the Plone instance, which you can access on localhost:8080.

This is an experimental setup. YMMV. The provided configs re-use your .bashrc,
re-use a /var/tmp buildout cache, re-use your ssh agent etc. You might have to
disable or reconfigure some of that if you're not on a Linux host.

If you use boot2docker on Mac OS X (Windows not tested) follow the instructions below.

The packages installed here cover not only normal Plone development,
but also anything needed to work on the prototype or the documentation.

Once you've completed all these steps and have the installation working, you can
exit via `^C` (end instance) `^D` (log out of docker app).

To re-run the instance you only need to `sudo make docker-run`
and then inside the app `bin/instance fg`.

It's also possible to run this `without sudo`_.

Troubleshooting docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cleanup your docker image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

issue:
    e.g. make commands return a **command not found** error

.. note::

    If you accidentially doing something wrong outside the container / before you started the container shell, e.g. a "make" command, this may mess up your docker image.

You can clean this up by invoking a::

    git clean -fdx

This forces a clean up of your checkout including directories and ignored unversioned files. Make sure you have backups - ** Be careful!**

boot2docker – build issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

issue:
    **make docker-build** and **make docker-run** are not working with boot2docker.

Running a **make docker-build** command drops::

    docker.io build -t ploneintranet .
    make: docker.io: No such file or directory
    make: *** [docker-build] Error 1

If you use boot2docker on Mac OS X (Windows not tested) there are now alternate make commands in the Makefile:

To create the docker build, instead use:

1. `Install boot2docker`_ on your Mac or Windows machine.
2. `git clone git@github.com:ploneintranet/ploneintranet.git`
3. `cd ploneintranet`

.. note::

    with boot2docker you must run ther next commands `without sudo`_ !

    Remember to make sure you run them inside the docker container shell!

4. `make boot2docker-build` will prepare the docker image
5. `make boot2docker-run` will launch the docker image and give you a shell inside

boot2docker – docker environment not intialized
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

issue:
    running a docker command drops::

        docker error: /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory

You may need to `initialize your docker environment`_ variables properly to run a docker command successfully!

Export the boot2docker environment properly to run the docker-build process

1.  start boot2docker using "boot2docker up"
2.  The boot2docker VM is now running
3.  before "make boot2docker-build" run the command::

        $(boot2docker shellinit) # including the leading dollar character and brackets!

# continue with the build as described above

boot2docker – Service not accesible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

issue:
     you cannot find any running services under localhost

Use the "boot2docker ip" command to figure out what NAT ip your boot2docker vm is using. ** Use this ip instead of localhost with the expected port!**
